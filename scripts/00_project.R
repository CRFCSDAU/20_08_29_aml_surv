# Aims -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Myself and Laura McDonald our previous SpR , did a small project evaluating
# the impact of p53  (cell apoptosis protein ) & Bcl2 ( Cell Survival protein )
# expression by Immunohistochemistry (IHC)  on   bone marrow  biopsy for  our
# acute myeloid leukaemia AML/high-risk Myelodyspalstic syndrome patients cohort
# Attached colour coded Excel sheet with details Age , Gender , date of
# diagnosis ,survival status , duration of survival since diagnosis ,treatment
# response until relapse / progression  and p53 & BL2 expression  ( positive vs
# negative ) Itâ€™s will established that  p53 positive ( high expression )
# associated with shorter survival and poor prognosis in AML, We would like to
# examine this in our cohort , the same applied on BCL2 expression If you could
# get KM survival data  (PFS & OS) on this study will be appreciated Also , to
# examine the impact of p53 & BCL2 expression on survival  or any other variable
# such as  Denovo AML vs secondary AML vs Therapy related T-AML vs MDS Let me
# know if you need any further information Thanks EE
